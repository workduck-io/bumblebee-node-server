Why Bumblebee

> Everyone knows how hard it is to get people’s attention. However, even if you are successful in directing them to the website, just 5% of them will sign up.The competition is fierce. There is no other way to make them fall in love with your business than to show them what your current customers adore about you!

But it is not easy!

While we were redesigning our website, we noticed how difficult it was to share users’ tweets and Slack messages over the website. <<tech effort highlight maybe?>>

There are paid solutions that exist, but they all look the same with very bad experiences.
Even if you’re willing to compromise on the design, not all willing users get to provide feedback. Simply because they had to leave the website and publish it on Twitter. They get lost in the shuffle of hundreds of tweets and forget about you completely!

At Workduck we have devised a solution that we would like to share with you for FREE :)
We want to save your product team countless hours of work. That’s exactly what we set out to do as a company.

We designed the testimonial sidebar, which collects reviews and comments from places like Slack and Twitter and layers them in a vine-like structure on the side.
Making it possible for your website’s users to add to or start a new tweet or slack discussion directly from the homepage!
