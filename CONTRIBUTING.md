## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you find an issue with the repository or have a feature request with Bumblebee Node Server, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/workduck-io/bumblebee-node-server/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/workduck-io/bumblebee-node-server/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](https://github.com/workduck-io/bumblebee-node-server/labels) for more information. As a general rule. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as the node package manager. Ensure you have them installed before continuing.

- `$ git clone https://github.com/workduck-io/bumblebee-node-server.git`
- `$ cd bumblebee-node-server/`

If you are having issues ensure you are using the following versions of Node:

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the PR template appropriately so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
  Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
